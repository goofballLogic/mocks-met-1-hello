Logins oh logins

When a person appears on an application they are unknown to us because we choose not to find out yet.
There are possible ways for a person to specify their identity: mandated, volunteered and on-demand

But really, we could do without identity entirely. All we really need is the ability to persist.
Maybe instead of logging in we should just ask users to open persistence locations for us.

So the process would work a little like this:
1. Show screen where it's possible to do work
2. Show currently open storage locations
3. On command, prompt to open a new storage location
4. Choose storage location type (Google drive)
5. Redirect to login as necessary (Google login)
6. Choose existing folder or create a new one


Lets try this.
